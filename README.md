  <h2>A pure V library with tools for computational molecular biology</h2>

v-bio is a library that provides a set of tools for computational molecular biology purposes. v-bio is heavily based on existing bio tools for Python - biopython (DISCLAIMER: it is not a port). There are many similarities between biopython and v-bio, therefore biopython users should not have any problems with adaptation to v-bio (besides knowing the vlang itself)
